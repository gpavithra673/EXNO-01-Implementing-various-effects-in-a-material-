# EXP 01 - EFFECTS IN UNREAL

###### NAME: PAVITHRA G
###### REG NO: 212221240036 

## AIM:

To Implement various effects in a material such as emissive, roughness, and metallic properties in Unreal Engine.

## PROCEDURE:

### 1. Right-click in the content browser and choose material.  Rename the material and double-click to open it.

### 2. Right-click in the working space and search for constants. In constant choose constant vector 

### 3. After this double click on the constant vector 4 and edit the colour using the colour picker.

### 4. After adjusting the colour click okay and save it.

### 5. They join the output of the constant vector 4 to the base colour.

### 6. Create a single constant using step 3 and adjust its value of it using detail panel by
adjusting the value.

### 7. And you can apply this constant value to metallic, roughness, emissive colour etc..

### 8. For emissive you need to multiply the constant vector 4 and constant and apply it to
emissive colour.

### 9. For creating walls and gate you need to create a material and import a png image.

### 10. And use the png image as texture sample and connect the (rgb) of texture sample to
the emissive colour & connect the alpha value of texture sample to the opacity.

### 11. The save it, go to the third person example map and create a plane or cube apply the
material which you have created for the wall or gate.

## OUTPUT:

### BASIC COLOUR:
